[The black fades. The camera tracks forward in a straight line.
Allies and enemies locked in brutal combat.]

[Instant black]

"There was no mercy."

[The camera pointed at another fighting.]

[Cut to a friendly NPC. He is in hard fight.]

NPC: "Run! Get to bridge, send the message! Now!"

[Cut to the protagonist from behind.]

[Dolly zoom, revealing just how many enemies are ahead.
An overwhelming wall of hostiles closing in.]

[The protagonist turns and runs toward the camera.
The camera pulls back as they sprint.]

[The protagonist dives through a doorway.
The door slams shut behind them.
Instant black.]

"But the communications array... was already destroyed."

"Just like the rest of the crew."

"You were the only one who survived."

"And now…"

"Your only chance of rescue...
...is to recover every last component."
